# ODSC 2019

## Proposal

# Time Series Analysis in Python Workshop
“Time is precious so is Time Series Analysis”

Time series analysis has been around for centuries helping us to solve from astronomical problems to business problems and advanced scientific research around us now. Time stores precious information, which most machine learning algorithms don’t deal with. But time series analysis, which is a mix of machine learning and statistics helps us to get useful insights. Time series can be applied to various fields like economy forecasting, budgetary analysis, sales forecasting, census analysis and much more. In this workshop, We will look at how to dive deep into time series data and make use of deep learning to make accurate predictions.

Structure of the workshop goes like this

* Introduction to Time series analysis
* Time Series Exploratory Data Analysis and Data manipulation with pandas
* Forecast Time series data with some classical method (AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, GARCH, E-GARCH)
* Introduction to Deep Learning and Time series forecasting using MLP and LSTM
* Boosting Techniques
* Financial Time Series data

## Libraries Used:
> install libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt 

* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* matplotlib
* Keras 
* statsmodels
* prophet
* XGBoost
